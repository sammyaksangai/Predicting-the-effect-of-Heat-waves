# Predicting the effect of Heat-waves on human body

Heat Wave is not known as a disaster among common people. However, the fact that more than 4500 people have died due to heat waves in India since last 4 years makes heat waves not just a common threat, but a natural disaster. The effect of Heat waves is only expected to increase in upcoming years. So it's time we find a concrete solution to deal with it.

We plan to make an app using which the user will not just find out about the timeline of the next heatwave, but also its effect on him/her personally. Some input data will be taken from the user (for eg. his age, weight, daily water intake) and that will be used to compute whether the upcoming heat wave can prove fatal for him/her or not(provided he remains exposed to it for long enough). If it is fatal, the app will issue an alert to him.
